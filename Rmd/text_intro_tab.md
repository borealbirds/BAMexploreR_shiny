<br>

The BAM Landbird Models Viewer allow to explore and download BAM Landbird density map produced by the Boreal Avian Modelling Centre (BAM). 
The BAM Landbird density models are species-specific predictions of the density of breeding male birds per hectare at a 1km resolution across 
the boreal forest. They are produced with a generalized analytical approach to model landbird species density in relation to environmental 
predictors, using in-person or ARU point-count surveys and widely available spatial predictors. See the help section for more details.

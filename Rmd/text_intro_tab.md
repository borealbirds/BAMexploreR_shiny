# Welcome to the BAM Landbird Models Explorer

</center>

<br>

The BAM Landbird Models Explorer is an Shiny application for downloading and analyzing landbird density models produced by the Boreal Avian Modelling Centre (BAM). 

<br>

The BAM Landbird density models are species-specific predictions of the density of breeding male birds per hectare at a 1km resolution across the boreal forest. They are produced with a generalized analytical approach to model landbird species density in relation to environmental  predictors, using in-person or ARU point-count surveys and widely available spatial predictors. See the help section for more details. 

<br>

The BAM Landbird Models Explorer has three sections:

**1.** *Model access* Select, view, and download the model products of interest. *Note you must complete this section before using either of the other two sections*

**2.** *Population distribution* Evaluate distribution and population size from the models.   
**3.** *Predictor importance* Explore the relative importance of environmental predictors in the models.

Other options for model access include:
- **1. [BAMexploreR R package](https://github.com/borealbirds/BAMexploreR)** - download and analyze rasters directly in the R environment.
- **2. [Google Earth Engine viewer](https://borealbirds-gee.projects.earthengine.app/view/landbirdmodels)** - view and explore the version 5 Canada-wide models and uncertainty over Google imagery.
- **3. [BAM model website](https://borealbirds.github.io/)** - view predictions and metadata for the version 4 Canada-wide models.
- **4. [BAM Geoportal](http://data.borealbirds.ca/srv/eng/catalog.search#/home)** - download the landbird models and BAM's other model products.
